**Game:** Paddle Shift!

**Background:**

Paddle Shift! is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972.
The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach a given number of points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other. The reason I chose to design this game is because this is the very first game I played as a child and has been one of my all time favorites ever since.

**Week 1:**

1) Setting up the board, the middle boundary and the paddles.
2) Making the paddles move up and down within the board.
3) Adding logic for when the paddles should move up and when to move down.

**Week 2:**
1) Adding a ball to the board.
2) Making the ball move within the boundary.
3) Adding logic for the balls to bounce off the paddles.

**Week 3:**

1) Adding scores for the players each time a player wins.
2) Displaying the scores on each player's side.

**Stretch goals:**

1) To add more than 1 ball for a higher difficulty level or increase the CPU's efficiency for a greater difficulty level.
2) To add background music after a player wins and an appropriate message.
